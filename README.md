# Landing Page

Welcome to the repository for my personal website's landing page! This project is designed to showcase my portfolio, experience, and contact information in a clean and responsive design.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content on the page.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout, including the use of CSS variables for consistency and scalability.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and dynamic content.
- **Next.js**: For building the website with server-side rendering capabilities.

## 🚀 Features

- **Responsive Design**: The landing page is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, including mobile devices.
- **Dynamic Project Links**: Buttons positioned at the bottom right of the page with a faded background effect when clicked.
- **Clickable Timeline Logos**: The timeline section includes clickable company logos that link directly to the company's website.
- **Customizable Portfolio**: Portfolio images with large titles in the color of Mars and captions in white, designed to be fully transparent and integrated into the website.
- **Contact Form**: A consistent design with light text color, rounded borders, and an optional subject field.
